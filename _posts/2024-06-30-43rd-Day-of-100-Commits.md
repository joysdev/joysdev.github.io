I may or may not have a "more-developed" commit today. I'm going to set my weekly goals and then see, because I need to get to bed early tonight. I'm continuing interviewing for my next position tomorrow, and I must be ready to go by 9. 

Since I'm not working my old job, I want to increase my programming, but not back to 20 hours because I am still job-searching, and I want to finish up my community service hours ASAP. 15 hours programming seems right, because it does sound achievable, but also I admit I'm not 100% confident, so it won't be "easy". I want to finish up this survey form by end of tomorrow, even if I haven't demonstrated _all_ that I know with it yet. I do want to get the checkboxes in order at the very least, and I'd like to clean it up a little using Flexbox and adjusting margins and padding. I could also move on to the next project in order to apply those skills, which is why I won't be super disappointed if I just wrap it up tomorrow. Bonus points if I can figure out how to get the test to run and pass, but I'm not gonna spend too much time trying-if my page displays ok in the browser, that will be Good Enough. I want to keep up momentum by either starting another project, or advancing in the lessons. 

Outside of programming, I have set a long-term goal to thru-hike the Colorado Trail in the summer of 2026. This will most likely show up in my projects...

Update: I got the tests to run and pass-woohoo! My checkboxes won't line up-boo!

Good-night.
