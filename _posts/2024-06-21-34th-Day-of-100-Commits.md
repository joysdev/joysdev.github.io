Why are my github and local repos not matching? Is there a way to fix it or should I delete and start over? It looks like I lost all my beginnersmind files and my progress on odin-recipes. Ok they are still there, but only on github, not local. 

Re-cloned beginnersmind and I have all my files back on local, but now I see a file identical to my github pages in there, just without all the other files that are still in my real joysdev.github.io. Now I see in my gui, all my other repos are there as files too, also empty. The changes I made to odin-recipes are missing in my actual odin-recipes files. 

I feel so lost-I don't know where I went so wrong or how to fix it. And dissatisfied to have spent almost two hours trying to untangle this mess and not have gotten anywhere. 

Back to lessons tomorrow.
