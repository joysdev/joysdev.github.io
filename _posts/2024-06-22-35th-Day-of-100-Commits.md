# Wherein I realize I know less than I thought about how git and Github actually work

I don't know where I am going wrong when I try to create a Github repo to push my local work to. I think it's working fine the other way around, but I end up with weird nested doubles and nothing matching when I start work locally. And I don't understand how "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit" is returned from "git status" in a repo I've only ever had locally.

I achieved a little over my time goal this week which I'm trying hard to feel good about while I feel disappointed and frustrated that I haven't yet made any progress on my projects to count towards my goal to develop my commits. 

Annnd-it's bedtime again... Hasta ma√±ana.
