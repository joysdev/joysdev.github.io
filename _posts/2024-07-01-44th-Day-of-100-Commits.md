I got my checkboxes lined up with their labels! Turns out I just needed to add the class attribute with a value of inline, which I noticed first thing today when I returned to the [freecodeCamp registration form lesson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form/) and compared it to my html. My code is neither clean nor pretty, but it is passing which is Good Enough for right now! 


When I open other repos, and do git status, I keep getting told I have a bunch of untracked files from a variety of other repos. For instance, I just cloned my Lucy repo to local. When I open the folder in VSCode, I see 11 pending changes, and git status shows me it's this project among some other bits and pieces that I'm certain I've committed because I can see the commits on my Github, and when I open the folders, like here, and do git status it shows me exactly what I expect. Add this to the list of questions I don't know where to begin figuring out how to ask.
