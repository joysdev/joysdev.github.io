By the time this is published I will have achieved more than 21 hours of study/practice this week, which is <1 hour longer than my goal! To celebrate, I am setting new goals... This week I want to put in at least 21 hours again. In that time, I want to continue publishing a blog post every day, figure out a few personally-interesting elements, and my reach-goal is to incorporate those elements here (it's a reach because I am currently deeply daunted by how to modify my existing Jekyll theme).
