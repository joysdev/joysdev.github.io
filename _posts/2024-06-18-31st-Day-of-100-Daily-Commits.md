## Relatively realistic goal-setting

After briefly researching what it takes to build an app, I no longer feel I am ready to start setting SMART goals-yet. I will contnue working steadily to stabilize and add to my HTML and CSS skillset. My next step-up goal will be trying some Javascript lessons and/or returning to Harvard CS50.

This week, my goal is to study/practice/post at least 10 hours (I'm dropping my total due to job searching).
