It has been one of those days where every half-step requires a search, and research must be done to understand what that search's results mean, and even when I figure it out, I'm not achieving my desired outcome. For example, it is starting to annoy me that my VSCode terminal's underscores are invisible. I now know that it's not just me with this problem, and that lots of people solved it by changing their terminal font style or size. On my way to do that, I learned that the version of command key that works on my setup is actually just Ctrl. So I learned how to open my JSON settings, and in editing them, I learned that quotes and commas are critical. I saved and restarted a few times, and none of my changes have taken effect. 

I want to end my study/practice on a high note, but it is getting late and I'm getting tired of trying to find something I can succeed at. 

I know from experience I usually wind up regretting pushing past a certain lateness of hour, but tonight I gambled with a few more searches. The 7th Google return for "vscode terminal font changes not applying" was [this helpful blog post](https://blog.danskingdom.com/Update-your-terminal-prompt-and-font-in-Windows-Terminal-and-VS-Code-and-Visual-Studio/). I still don't understand why my JSON changes didn't take effect, and I'd prefer to learn the more code-y ways to solve problems, but this is Enough for tonight.
