I think my first certification project has fulfilled all the instructions-when I check it out in a browser, it looks/works fine, but when I click Run the Tests or hit Ctrl + Enter, nothing happens, which is disappointing. I'm tired of feeling disappointed so I'm taking this as a sign to do my own "certification" projects!
