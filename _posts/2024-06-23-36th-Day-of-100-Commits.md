# Too much to do or too little time?

I’m feeling fractured with my constant job search, striving for fitness, trying to learn programming, making an effort to succeed in probation, reducing my sugar intake, being a good mom/roommate/citizen, and this is not my whole list. I’m making measurable progress towards goals and have achieved some things I thought would be impossible, but I don’t feel very good about myself or my place in the world.

This week, my programming goals are at least 10 hours study/practice/blog. I am resetting my goal to develop my commits-I want to push daily changes to either personal or tutorial projects, such as [freecodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)’s Responsive Web Design certification projects.
