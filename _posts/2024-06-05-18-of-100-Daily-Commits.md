I'm noticing significant disappointment I don't have much to show for all that I am doing, and more importantly all that I'm doing better, and increasingly by heart, during all the time I ~~spend on~~ invest in editing this repo. I know this is one hallmark of this very-beginner phase, so I remind myself I can view it as a test of my will. It does feel good to be getting better at troubleshooting, or at least more able to see why something isn't working.
