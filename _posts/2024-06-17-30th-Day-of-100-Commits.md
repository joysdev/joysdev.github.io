## 30 Days!

I want to take this milestone (monthstone?) to recognize both what I have accomplished, and what I want to do from here.

In the last 30 days, I have spent time _every day_ learning and practicing programming. I have built a habit that I can honestly say I look forward to fulfilling, even when I feel lost and frustrated. I have a blog now, and as I work my way through lessons (mostly [freecodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) atm), I have built some muscle memory and noticeable improvement in discerning where my code is faulty when it doesn't pass.  

Now I'm gonna set some less than SMART goals-I'll work on specificity and measurability and all that later. First, I brainstorm: I want to work on my commits being more than just "Create Day X post". I want to start building my own projects, even though I'm not yet capable of more than the most basic HTML and CSS. I also want to network-online would be a good start, but ideally, I want to find some in-person meetups. Although networking would probably benefit me in lots of ways, I'm not going to set specific goals in that realm until I get situated in a more sustainable dayjob. I need to set that schedule first, then I can more earnestly work on filling the rest of my calendar. 

Two projects I could begin working on are an interval timer for figure models and a toilet paper price analysis app. First, I need to do some research on these kinds of projects, and then I can set some reasonable goal chunks. Tomorrow, I will spend at least 1 hour on this and report my findings here.
