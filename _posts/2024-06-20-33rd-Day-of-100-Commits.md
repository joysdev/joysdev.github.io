# First Day of Summer 2024

Today I wrapped up the [freecodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) lesson I was working through, so tomorrow I will begin working on some of the certification project and/or experimenting with applying the skills I'm learning to my own projects, in an effort to mature my daily commits.

While on a mountain adventure with my daughter this afternoon, I unearthed my past inspiration to use the media I collect from hikes on websites. I already know I enjoy using photos not only as background images, etc, but also I'll take pictures in order to later pick out colors for themes. I hope to use audio I collect for a meditation video, or maybe even a mindfulness app. I also think it could be fun to make a website for identifying scat!
