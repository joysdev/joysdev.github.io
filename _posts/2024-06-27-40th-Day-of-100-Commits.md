# Cooking with gas 

I know it's just a survey form, but making my way through the project more smoothly than I expected is building my confidence. I'm glad to be unsurprised that even this simple project has plenty of space for creativity. Relishing the feeling that I can nearly sense new neuronal connections forming and strengthening. 

I suspect I will rely on the [freecodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) tutorials as references in addition to setting some good habits.
