Even though I'm not exactly whizzing through my first project, I am feeling a pleasant sense of growing confidence to be achieving my goal of developing my commits. 

I want this post to also serve as a record that things do not always turn out as bad as I can imagine-I expected submitting my resignation at work to result in negative feedback etc, and it simply hasn't!
