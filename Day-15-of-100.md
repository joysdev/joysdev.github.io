# Day 15 of 100
## Take 3

A little more than two weeks ago, I set a goal to write a daily blog as I learn programming. I created a Github Pages site, and every day I have been committing brief entries. I've been buried so deep in my learning that I didn't look up my blog. I got curious a few days ago, and to my dismay, only my first post had published!

I don't yet understand where I went wrong, but I have spent at least 10 hours trying to get my posts published. I even deleted and started over 3 times! 

I'm depleted now, but if this publishes, I will list what steps I took to get things back on track.
